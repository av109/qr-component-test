## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- **CSS Flexbox**: Utilized Flexbox to center the card both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries to adjust the card's width and font sizes for smaller screens.
- **Box Shadow**: Added a subtle shadow to the card for a more polished look.
- **Font Import**: Imported and applied Google Fonts (`Outfit`) for a modern typography style.
- **Positioning**: Used absolute positioning for the footer to ensure it stays at the bottom of the page.
- **Image Styling**: Applied border-radius to images for rounded corners, enhancing the visual appeal.
- **Text Styling**: Controlled text width and margins for better readability and alignment within the card.
